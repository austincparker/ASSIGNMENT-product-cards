## Overview of Project

This was our first project ever. It involved building cards using html and css. We were given guidelines on how to format the site and had to use flexbox to do so.

## List of Features

- Five cards displaying unique items.
- Cards have have 3 sections formatted according to the instructions.
- Cards fit 3 to a row.
- One card has a sold out 'sticker' on it positioned over the item image.
- Page is responsive.

## Steps in Project

- Created html, css, and js files.
- Made the starting div for the first card.
- Inserted divs to represent each section of the card.
- Inserted p and img tags where neccessary and pasted some hipster ipsum in there.
- Once the first card was complete, I copied and pasted the card skeleton a few times.
- Once the cards were in place, I began formatting them.
- I purposefully did not use Bootstrap, because I wanted to get practice using flex-box without it. I already know how to format and make things look pretty with Bootstrap.
- The cards may not look very pretty, but I think that the desired end result was accomplished.

### What I learned:

If I want to make some cards quickly and make them look good, Bootstrap is my friend.
